# Firebase Installations Quickstart

The Firebase Installations Test Application (testapp) demonstrates fetching and
deleting Installations using the Firebase Installations API of the
[Firebase Unity SDK](https://firebase.google.com/docs/unity/setup).

## Requirements

* [Unity](http://unity3d.com/) 5.3 or higher.
* [Xcode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/) 10.3 or higher
  (when developing for iOS).
* [Android SDK](https://developer.android.com/studio/index.html#downloads)
  (when developing for Android).


## Building the Sample

### iOS

  - Register your iOS app with Firebase.
    - Create a project in the
      [Firebase console](https://firebase.google.com/console/),
      and associate your iOS application.
      - You should use `com.google.firebase.unity.installations.testapp` as the
        package name while you're testing.
        - If you do not use the prescribed package name you will need to update
          the bundle identifier as described in the
          `Optional: Update the Project Bundle Identifier` below.
    - Download the `GoogleService-Info.plist` file associated with your
      Firebase project from the console.
      This file identifies your iOS app to the Firebase backend, and will
      need to be included in the sample later.
    - For further details please refer to the
      [general instructions](https://firebase.google.com/docs/ios/setup)
      which describes how to configure a Firebase application for iOS.
  - Download the
    [Firebase Unity SDK](https://firebase.google.com/download/unity)
    and unzip it somewhere convenient.
  - Open the sample project in the Unity editor.
    - Select the `File > Open Project` menu item.
    - Click `Open`.
    - Navigate to the sample directory `testapp` in the file dialog and click
      `Open`.
  - Open the scene `MainScene`.
    - Navigate to `Assets/Firebase/Sample/Installations` in the `Project` window.
    - Double click on `MainScene` file to open.
  - Import the `Firebase Installations` plugin.
    - Select the **Assets > Import Package > Custom Package** menu item.
    - From the [Firebase Unity SDK](https://firebase.google.com/download/unity)
      downloaded previously, import `FirebaseInstallations.unitypackage` from the
      directory that matches the version of Unity you use:
       - Unity 5.x and earlier use the .NET 3.x framework, so you need to
         import the `dotnet3/FirebaseInstallations.unitypackage` package .
       - Unity 2017.x and newer allow the use of the .NET 4.x framework.  If
         your project is configured to use .NET 4.x, import the
         `dotnet4/FirebaseInstallations.unitypackage` package.
    - When the **Import Unity Package** window appears, click the **Import**
      button.
  - Add the `GoogleService-Info.plist` file to the project.
    - Navigate to the `Assets/Firebase/Sample/Installations` folder in the
      `Project` window.
    - Drag the `GoogleService-Info.plist` downloaded from the Firebase console
      into the folder.
      - NOTE: `GoogleService-Info.plist` can be placed anywhere under the
        `Assets` folder.
  - Optional: Update the Project Bundle Identifier
    - If you did not use `com.google.firebase.unity.installations.testapp`
      as the project package name you will need to update the sample's Bundle
      Identifier.
      - Select the `File > Build Settings` menu option.
      - Select `iOS` in the `Platform` list.
      - Click `Player Settings`
      - In the `Player Settings` panel scroll down to `Bundle Identifier`
        and update the value to the package name you provided when you
        registered your app with Firebase.
  - Build for iOS
    - Select the `File > Build Settings` menu option.
    - Select `iOS` in the `Platform` list.
    - Click `Switch Platform` to select `iOS` as the target platform.
    - Wait for the spinner (compiling) icon to stop in the bottom right corner
      of the Unity status bar.
    - Click `Build and Run`.
  - See the *Using the Sample* section below.


### Android

  - Register your Android app with Firebase.
    - Create a project in the
      [Firebase console](https://firebase.google.com/console/),
      and attach your Android app to it.
      - You should use `com.google.firebase.unity.installations.testapp` as the
        package name while you're testing.
        - If you do not use the prescribed package name you will need to update
          the bundle identifier as described in the
          `Optional: Update the Project Bundle Identifier` below.

      - To [generate a SHA1](https://developers.google.com/android/guides/client-auth),
        first you will need to set the keystore in the Unity project.
        - Locate the `Publishing Settings` under `Player Settings`.
        - Select an existing keystore, or create a new keystore using the toggle.
        - Select an existing key, or create a new key using "Create a new key".
      - After setting the keystore and key, you can generate a SHA1 by
        running this command:
        ```
        keytool -exportcert -list -v -alias <key_name> -keystore <path_to_keystore>
        ```
    - Download the `google-services.json` file associated with your
        Firebase project from the console.
        This file identifies your Android app to the Firebase backend, and will
        need to be included in the sample later.
      - For further details please refer to the
        [general instructions](https://firebase.google.com/docs/android/setup)
        which describes how to configure a Firebase application for Android.
