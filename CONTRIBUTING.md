## <a name="coc"></a> Code of Conduct

As contributors and maintainers of the Firebase Unity Quickstarts project, we
pledge to respect everyone who contributes by posting issues, updating
documentation, submitting pull requests, providing feedback in comments, and
any other activities.

Communication through any of Firebase's channels (GitHub, StackOverflow,
Google+, Twitter, etc.) must be constructive and never resort to personal
attacks, trolling, public or private harassment, insults, or other
unprofessional conduct.

We promise to extend courtesy and respect to everyone involved in this project
regardless of gender, gender identity, sexual orientation, disability, age,
race, ethnicity, religion, or level of experience. We expect anyone
contributing to the project to do the same.

If any member of the community violates this code of conduct, the maintainers
of the Firebase Unity Quickstarts project may take action, removing issues,
comments, and PRs or blocking accounts as deemed appropriate.

## <a name="question"></a> Got a Question or Problem?

If you have questions about how to use the Firebase Unity Quickstarts, please
direct these to [StackOverflow][stackoverflow] and use the `firebase` tag. We
are also available on GitHub issues.

If you feel that we're missing an important bit of documentation, feel free to
file an issue so we can help. Here's an example to get you started:

```
What are you trying to do or find out more about?

Where have you looked?

Where did you expect to find this information?
```

## <a name="issue"></a> Found an Issue?
If you find a bug in the source code or a mistake in the documentation, you can
help us by submitting an issue to our [GitHub Repository][github]. Even better
you can submit a Pull Request with a fix.

See [below](#submit) for some guidelines.

### Submitting an Issue
Before you submit your issue, search the archive, maybe your question was
already answered.

If your issue appears to be a bug, and hasn't been reported, open a new issue.
Help us to maximize the effort we can spend fixing issues and adding new
features, by not reporting duplicate issues.  Providing the following
information will increase the chances of your issue being dealt with quickly:

* **Overview of the Issue** - if an error is being thrown a stack trace with
  symbols helps
* **Motivation for or Use Case** - explain why this is a bug for you
* **Operating System** - is this a problem for all operating systems?
* **Reproduce the Error** - provide a live example or a unambiguous set of
  steps.
* **Related Issues** - has a similar issue been reported before?
* **Suggest a Fix** - if you can't fix the bug yourself, perhaps you can point
  to what might be causing the problem (line of code or commit)

**If you get help, help others. Good karma rulez!**

Here's a template to get you started:

```
Operating system:
Operating system version:

What steps will reproduce the problem:
1.
2.
3.

What is the expected result?

What happens instead of that?

Please provide any other information below, and attach a screenshot if possible.
```

### Submitting a Pull Request
Before you submit your pull request consider the following guidelines:

* Search [GitHub](https://github.com/firebase/quickstart-unity/pulls) for an
  open or closed Pull Request that relates to your submission. You don't want
  to duplicate effort.
* Please sign our [Contributor License Agreement (CLA)](#cla) before sending
  pull requests. We cannot accept code without this.
* Make your changes in a new git branch:

     ```shell
     git checkout -b my-fix-branch master
     ```

* Create your patch, **including appropriate test cases**.
* Follow our [Coding Rules](#rules).
* Avoid checking in files that shouldn't be tracked (e.g `.tmp`, `.idea`).
  We recommend using a [global](#global-gitignore) gitignore for this.
* Commit your changes using a descriptive commit message.

     ```shell
     git commit -a
     ```
  Note: the optional commit `-a` command line option will automatically "add"
  and "rm" edited files.

* Build your changes locally and run the applications to verify they're still
  functional.

* Push your branch to GitHub:

    ```shell
    git push origin my-fix-branch
    ```

* In GitHub, send a pull request to `firebase/quickstart-unity:master`.
* If we suggest changes then:
  * Make the required updates.
  * Rebase your branch and force push to your GitHub repository (this will
    update your Pull Request):

    ```shell
    git rebase master -i
    git push origin my-fix-branch -f
    ```

That's it! Thank you for your contribution!

#### After your pull request is merged

After your pull request is merged, you can safely delete your branch and pull
the changes from the main (upstream) repository:

* Delete the remote branch on GitHub either through the GitHub UI or your local
  shell as follows:

    ```shell
    git push origin --delete my-fix-branch
    ```

* Check out the master branch:

    ```shell
    git checkout master -f
    ```

* Delete the local branch:

    ```shell
    git branch -D my-fix-branch
    ```

* Update your master with the latest upstream version:

    ```shell
    git pull --ff upstream master
    ```
